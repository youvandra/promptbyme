# Database Architecture: Centralized vs Distributed User References

## Current Architecture (Recommended)

```
auth.users (id: uuid) - Supabase managed authentication
├── users (id: uuid → auth.users.id) - Profile data
├── prompts (user_id: uuid → auth.users.id) - User's prompts  
└── likes (user_id: uuid → auth.users.id) - User's likes
```

### Why This Works Better:

1. **Performance**: Direct foreign keys = faster queries
2. **RLS Optimization**: `auth.uid()` works directly
3. **Supabase Best Practice**: Recommended by Supabase docs
4. **Independence**: Each table can function independently

## Alternative Architecture (Your Suggestion)

```
auth.users (id: uuid) - Supabase managed
└── users (id: uuid, auth_id: uuid → auth.users.id) - Central user table
    ├── prompts (user_id: uuid → users.id) - References central table
    └── likes (user_id: uuid → users.id) - References central table
```

### Why This Could Work But Isn't Optimal:

1. **Extra Joins**: Every query needs to join through users table
2. **RLS Complexity**: Policies become more complex
3. **Performance Impact**: Additional table lookups
4. **Single Point of Failure**: Users table issues affect everything

## Real-World Example

### Current Approach (Fast):
```sql
-- Get user's prompts - 1 table scan
SELECT * FROM prompts WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- RLS policy - Direct check
CREATE POLICY "Users see own prompts" ON prompts
FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Your Approach (Slower):
```sql
-- Get user's prompts - 2 table join
SELECT p.* FROM prompts p 
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id 
WHERE u.auth_id = auth.uid();

-- RLS policy - Subquery required
CREATE POLICY "Users see own prompts" ON prompts
FOR SELECT USING (
  user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## Conclusion

Your approach is **architecturally valid** but **performance-suboptimal** for Supabase.

The current design IS centralized - `auth.users.id` is the central authority. We just reference it directly for performance and simplicity.

Think of it like this:
- **Your way**: Everyone asks the receptionist, who then asks the manager
- **Current way**: Everyone asks the manager directly (faster, but still controlled)

Both work, but the current approach is faster and follows Supabase best practices.
